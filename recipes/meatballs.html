        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a step by step recipe for meatballs with almond sauce. 
            Fried potatoes or rice work quite well as a side dish for this.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon of nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>5 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>4 slices of stale bread</li>
            <li>A little parsley</li>
            <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>1 egg or 2</li>
            <li>1/2 a glass of white wine</li>
            <li>Minced meat (prefereably from the butcher, beef and pork)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a pot, add the onion (roughly chopped, since it will be blended later),
                the bread slices and the almonds. Add 1 teaspoon of salt and some oil. 
                Saut√© until softened.
            </li>
            <li>Once the onion is tender, remove everything from the pot and blend with a 
                hand blender in a tall container. Return the blended mixture to the pot. 
                Add the white wine and enough water to fill the pot to just below halfway.
            </li>
            <li>Keep the sauce simmering on low heat. In a bowl, mix the minced meat with 1 
                chopped garlic clove, parsley, nutmeg, and 2 teaspoons of salt. Add the egg. 
                Mix with your hands, gradually adding breadcrumbs until the mixture no longer 
                sticks to your hands.
            </li>
            <li>Increase the heat, form meatballs, and add them to the pot with the sauce. 
                Cook for about 30 minutes, or longer if the sauce needs to get texture.
            </li>

        </ol>
